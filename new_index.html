          <h1>HOCKING ATHENS PERRY COUNTY ACTION (HAPCAP)</h1>
          <hr>
          <div class="col-md-8 mx-auto">
            <p class="hapcap-text text-left"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n non-emergent cases, Athens County has access to a cheaper mode of transportation through the Hocking Athens Perry Community Action (HAPCAP). HAPCAP has been working to
              improve the community’s quality of life in the Tri-County area since the early 1960’s.
              <br><br>
              One of the five divisions of this nonprofit is transportation, including five transit programs.
              <br><br>
              Jessie Schmitzer, the Athens and Hocking County mobility manager with HAPCAP, plays a key role in the transportation services HAPCAP offers.
              <br><br>
              “Athens On Demand Transit is a door to door service that services all of Athens county and services anybody for any reason,” Schmitzer said.
              <br><br>
              This service was originally for senior citizens and individuals with disabilities for $1 one way, but as of Jan. 1, 2020, can now be used by anyone for the cost of $2 one way.
              <br><br>
              “I'm seeing a lot of people that might have recurring appointments that they can get transportation to sometimes, but not all the time,” Schmitzer said. “A big reason for that is because our transportation programs are really at
              capacity because there's such a huge need.”
              <br><br>
              “So we got together with Athens on Demand Transit and Green Cab, and came up with this really cool collaboration. If someone is stranded at the emergency room, then OhioHealth staff can call either Athens On Demand Transit or Green Cab,
              depending on the time of day, and they could go pick them up at the cost of OhioHealth and then bring them back home,” Schmitzer said.
