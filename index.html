              County EMS, Rick Calebs, recounted the search for a victim of a logging accident in February of this year. While dispatch knew that the caller was located on Mountville Road, on the border of Athens and Morgan Counties, the precise
              location was difficult to find.</p>

            Since the accident was not visible from the road, the EMTs began traveling down the street from one end, waiting to be flagged down by the caller. According to Chief Calebs, this accident is an example of many where locating a caller is
            problematic. As he describes it, the time it can take for some callers to reach dispatch, and the lost time taken locating the scenes of accidents, can be the difference between life and death.

            To reach a lot of these unmarked locations, EMT drivers use different forms of GPS systems like google and apple maps. When these systems fail due to service issues or even lack of location, drivers are able to call back to an 911
            operator, to have them help locate the caller. It can take EMS to reach a caller in rural Athens County anywhere from 10-30 minutes, with the turnaround to a local hospital reaching around 60-75 minutes.

            Common issues for which Athens EMS receives calls include shortness of breath, chest pain, lung problems, heart problems and long-term health issues. Southeast Ohio experiences disproportionally high levels of illnesses such as depression, heart disease, and diabetes. This health crisis has gained the attention of health professionals in the area, who are seeking solutions that are accessible and reliable for patients.

          <h1>HOCKING ATHENS PERRY COUNTY ACTION (HAPCAP)</h1>
          <hr>
          <div class="col-md-8 mx-auto">
            <p class="hapcap-text text-left"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n non-emergent cases, Athens County has access to a cheaper mode of transportation through the Hocking Athens Perry Community Action (HAPCAP). HAPCAP has been working to
              improve the community’s quality of life in the Tri-County area since the early 1960’s.
              <br><br>
              One of the five divisions of this nonprofit is transportation, including five transit programs.
              <br><br>
              Jessie Schmitzer, the Athens and Hocking County mobility manager with HAPCAP, plays a key role in the transportation services HAPCAP offers.
              <br><br>
              “Athens On Demand Transit is a door to door service that services all of Athens county and services anybody for any reason,” Schmitzer said.
              <br><br>
              This service was originally for senior citizens and individuals with disabilities for $1 one way, but as of Jan. 1, 2020, can now be used by anyone for the cost of $2 one way.
              <br><br>
              “I'm seeing a lot of people that might have recurring appointments that they can get transportation to sometimes, but not all the time,” Schmitzer said. “A big reason for that is because our transportation programs are really at
              capacity because there's such a huge need.”
              <br><br>
              “So we got together with Athens on Demand Transit and Green Cab, and came up with this really cool collaboration. If someone is stranded at the emergency room, then OhioHealth staff can call either Athens On Demand Transit or Green Cab,
              depending on the time of day, and they could go pick them up at the cost of OhioHealth and then bring them back home,” Schmitzer said.
