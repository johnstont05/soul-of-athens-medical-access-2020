              of Athens County EMS, Rick
              Calebs, recounted the search for a victim of a logging accident in February 2020. While dispatch knew that the caller was located on Mountville Road, on the border of Athens and Morgan Counties, the precise location was difficult to
              find.</p>

            The accident was not able to be seen from the road, and the EMTs had to begin traveling down the winding narrow road from one end, waiting to be frantically flagged down by the caller. According to Chief Calebs, this is an example of many
            incidents in which locating a caller is problematic. As he describes it, the time it takes for some callers to reach dispatch and the time spent in locating the scene of the accident can be the difference between life and death. It took
            22 minutes for the EMTs to arrive at the location.

            experience poor or no cell service, requiring that people stand in one area of their house, or even outside of their house, in order to call 911. Many of these roads are unmarked, increasing the level of difficulty in searching for
            callers. While county engineers work to update signage in the area, signs are often knocked down by snow plows, may be vandalized or disappear for unknown reasons.

            To reach a lot of these unmarked locations, EMT drivers use different forms of GPS systems like Google and Apple maps. When these systems fail due to service issues or even lack of information about the location, drivers are able to call
            back to an 911 operator, to have them help locate the caller.

            “The mobile health units are essentially doctors’ offices on wheels,” Sherri Oliver explained. Oliver is the executive director for Community Health Programs and Area Health Education Center. The trucks are 40-feet long with two exam
            rooms and a waiting room. Nurse practitioners, medical students and registered nurses all travel in the mobile health unit to surrounding counties to provide medical care through various health clinics. These units present an opportunity
            for the Heritage College students to gain hands-on experience while interacting with real clients to provide a much needed service.

            <p class="text"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hile community leaders are working hard to ensure access to care for everyone, innovative programs like the mobile health units cannot address every need. “Sometimes we could take that medical
              health unit within maybe two miles of your house, [but] if you don’t have a vehicle to get to us, sometimes we’re still not totally meeting that transportation gap,” Oliver described.
              <br><br>
              In order to meet that gap, Oliver finds herself and her colleagues at the Community Health Program using grants or community donations to give people gas cards in order to help people travel to their health clinics.

            <p class="text">“We see a lot of people who have health insurance, but their health insurance has such a high deductible that they can’t really use it,” Oliver said. “So, they’ll still come to the free clinic and they’ll still seek out
              our services because they can’t access health care in a traditional setting.”
              <br><br>
              “I think that's a huge issue that we have to deal with as a society because some people view health care as a right. Other people are adamant that it's not a right [but a necessity],” Calebs said.

            When the uninsured or underinsured are unable to access care, the worlds of Sheri Oliver and Chief Calebs can collide. When these uninsured members of the community do not see doctors regularly, their health issues can snowball into more
            protracted problems and lead to more intense situations for EMS. Calebs says that some community members may not call an ambulance because they cannot afford it.
            <br><br>
            In addition, once they enter the health care system, the costs for care are higher than the initial visit would have been because their conditions are so much worse. More doctors visits mean more trips to be made, another hurdle for those
            living in rural areas where distances to specialists can be further.

            <p class="text"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n non-emergency cases, Athens County residents have access to a cheaper mode of transportation through the Hocking Athens Perry Community Action (HAPCAP). HAPCAP has been working to improve
              the community’s quality of life in the Tri-County area since the early 1960’s.
              <br><br>
              One of the five divisions of the nonprofit’s focus is transportation. In HAPCAP’s transit office, Athens and Hocking County mobility manager, Jessie Schmitzer, plays a key role in managing the services that HAPCAP offers.
              <br><br>
              “Athens On Demand Transit is a door-to-door service that services all of Athens county and services anybody for any reason,” Schmitzer said. Originally created for senior citizens and individuals with disabilities, as of Jan. 1, 2020,
              HAPAP has opened Athens On Demand for use by anyone, for the cost of $2 one way.
              <br><br>
              “I'm seeing a lot of people that might have recurring appointments that they can get transportation to sometimes, but not all the time,” Schmitzer said. “A big reason for that is because our transportation programs are really at
              capacity because there's such a huge need.”
              <br><br>
              The high demand for rides through HAPCAP-managed transportation programs can be an issue for riders banking on the program as their ticket to the doctor’s office. Schmitzer said that once someone knows when their next appointment is,
              they should call right away in order to reserve a ride in time.

          <p class="text">“So, we got together with Athens on Demand Transit and Green Cab, and came up with this really cool collaboration. If someone is stranded at the emergency room, then OhioHealth staff can call either Athens On Demand Transit
            or Green Cab, depending on the time of day, and they could go pick them up at the cost of OhioHealth and then bring them back home,” Schmitzer said.
            <br><br>
            As of March 30, 2020, following the Stay at Home Order enacted in response to COVID-19, HAPCAP has declared that Athens on Demand Transit will only be available for essential travel and essential activities. This includes health care
            appointments, grocery stores, pharmacy, and essential work locations. ADOT will also be eliminating all fares and will no longer provide service on Saturdays.
            <br><br>
            For Athens Public Transit, only 5 seated and 1 wheelchair passenger are to be on the buses at a time in order to keep passengers at least 6 feet apart from one another.

              n the past month, some people have raised concern about the availability of coronavirus tests to Southeast Ohio due to the lack of healthcare access in the area.
              <br><br>
              In response to these concerns, Ohio House Rep, Jay Edwards., has stated that the area is not running low on test kits. Edwards says that Southeast Ohio is “on par per capita with other areas of the state.”

            OhioHealth O'Bleness Hospital has begun preparation for possible COVID-19 surges by erecting emergency “triage tents” outside of the hospital’s Emergency Department. At the moment, the tents are being prepared as a precautionary measure.
            Fortunately, the spread of COVID-19 in the community has not yet reached a level that requires patient triage.

            Two tents are set up and a third will soon accompany them. Each tent will serve a different purpose. Patients are to be evaluated in the first tent, and depending on the physician’s determination, the patient will go into another tent for
            definite COVID-19 or yet another tent for possible COVID-19.
            <br><br>
            Paula Peterson, of Albany Ohio, is also doing well despite the spread of COVID-19. “I'm doing really great, and I don't see why that couldn't continue.” Peterson said she is pretty well isolated to begin with, so the COVID-19 pandemic has
            not changed her life much. She washes her hands more and disinfects her apartment once a week.
            <br><br>
            Although this time is mostly stress-free for Peterson, there is concern for her daughter-in-law. “She's in the emergency room right now and they're testing her for Corona. So that's stressing me out.” Peterson uses FaceTime to talk to her
            family during this time.

            “I'm really not terribly worried about it,” Peterson said. “My family has been really good about staying away since everything went to lock down.” In this time of crisis, Peterson’s attitude is to be appreciated. “If I get it, I get it,
            and there's nothing I can do about that except go to the hospital and God’s will [shall] be done.”
            <br><br>
            Outside of the current crisis Peterson uses alternative long-distance medical transportation. Peterson feels satisfied with her two medical care services: Hopewell and PASSPORT. Peterson is a disabled senior citizen, and is able to
            receive transportation through both of these services.
            <br><br>
            After being injured in 2008 while working as a nurse’s aide, Peterson had back surgery for a fractured vertebra, during which doctors discovered she also had severe scoliosis. Through PASSPORT, a waiver program administered through Ohio
            Medicaid, Peterson is assigned a nurse case manager and receives support from a home health aide two days a week.
            <br><br>
            “They've really helped me out a lot,” Peterson said. “If I've got to go even as far as Columbus to the doctors, PASSPORT will pay for it.”
            <br><br>
            “I'm doing pretty well, thanks be to God,” Peterson said.
            <br><br>
            The fight for better medical access in the southeast region continues to be an issue for affected communities, but through the help of community initiatives like HCOM, HAPCAP, and local EMS services, the solution becomes a little more
            clear.
