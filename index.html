            cell phone
            coverage throughout. For those who do not have access to reliable transportation or may be condensed to the landscape of the region, a miniscule task can seem like a burden. Athens EMS knows the impact of these situations due to the
            constant risk it may have on a life they are trying to save.

            <p class="text">Locating homes and finding their way to the scenes of accidents are just some of the difficulties The Athens County Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Station often faces on a daily basis. Chief of Athens County EMS, Rick
              Calebs, recounted the search for a victim of a logging accident in February 2020. While dispatch knew that the caller was located on Mountville Road, on the border of Athens and Morgan Counties, the precise location was difficult to
              find.</p>

            The accident was not able to be seen from the road, and the EMTs had to begin traveling down the winding narrow road from one end, waiting to be frantically flagged down by the caller. According to Chief Calebs, this is an example of many
            incidents in which locating a caller is problematic. As he describes it, the time it takes for some callers to reach dispatch and the time spent in locating the scene of the accident can be the difference between life and death. It took
            22 minutes for the EMTs to arrive at the location.

            experience poor or no cell service, requiring that people stand in one area of their house, or even outside of their house, in order to call 911. Many of these roads are unmarked, increasing the level of difficulty in searching for
            callers. While county engineers work to update signage in the area, signs are often knocked down by snow plows, may be vandalized or disappear for unknown reasons.

              <br><br>
              One of the five divisions of the nonprofit’s focus is transportation. In HAPCAP’s transit office, Athens and Hocking County mobility manager, Jessie Schmitzer, plays a key role in managing the services that HAPCAP offers. “Athens On
              Demand Transit is a door to door service that services all of Athens county and services anybody for any reason,” Schmitzer said. Originally provided for senior citizens and individuals with disabilities, as of Jan. 1, 2020, HAPAP has
              opened Athens On Demand for use by anyone, for the cost of $2 one way.

              lternative long-distance medical transport options are available for some residents of Southeast Ohio. Paula Peterson, of Albany Ohio, feels satisfied with her two medical care services: Hopewell and PASSPORT. Peterson is a disabled
              senior citizen, and is able to receive transportation through both of these services.
              <br><br>
              After being injured in 2008 while working as a nurse’s aide, Peterson had back surgery for a fractured vertebrae and discovered severe scoliosis. Through PASSPORT, a waiver program administered through Ohio Medicaid, Peterson is
              assigned a nurse case manager and receives home health aide two days a week.
              <br><br>
              “They've really helped me out a lot,” Peterson said. “If I've got to go even as far as Columbus to the doctors, PASSPORT will pay for it.”
              <br><br>
              “I'm doing pretty well, thanks be to God,” Peterson said.
              <br><br>
              Peterson is also doing well despite the spread of COVID-19. Spending time with her grandchildren is what Peterson misses the most. “I'm doing really great, and I don't see why that couldn't continue.” Peterson said she is pretty well
              isolated to begin with, so the COVID-19 pandemic has not changed her life much. She washes her hands more and disinfects her apartment once a week.

              Although this time is mostly stress free for Peterson, there is a concern for her daughter-in-law. “She's in the emergency room right now and they're testing her for Corona. So that's stressing me out.” Peterson uses FaceTime to talk to
              her family during

              “I'm really not terribly worried about it,” Peterson said. “My family has been really good about staying away since everything went to lock down.”

              In the past month, some have raised concerns about the availability of coronavirus tests to Southeast Ohio due to the lack of healthcare access in the area.
              <br><br>
              In response to these concerns, Ohio House Rep, Jay Edwards, R-Nelsonville, has stated that the area is not running low on test kits. Edwards says that Southeast Ohio is “on par per capita with other areas of the state.”</p>

          <p class="text">OhioHealth O'Bleness Hospital has begun preparation for possible COVID-19 surges by erecting emergency “triage tents” outside of the hospital in the Emergency Department. At the moment, the tents are prepared as a
            precautionary measure.
            Spread of COVID-19 in the community has not yet reached a level that requires patient triage.
            <br><br>
            Two tents are set up and a third will soon accompany them. Each tent will serve a different purpose. Patients are to be evaluated at the first tent and depending on the physician’s determination the patient will go into a tent for
            definite COVID-19 or a tent for possible COVID-19.
            <br><br>
            These tents are not for coronavirus testing.
