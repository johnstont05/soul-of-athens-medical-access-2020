              County EMS, Rick Calebs, recounted the search for a victim of a logging accident in February of this year. While dispatch knew that the caller was located on Mountville Road, on the border of Athens and Morgan Counties, the precise
              location was difficult to find.</p>

            Since the accident was not visible from the road, the EMTs began traveling down the street from one end, waiting to be flagged down by the caller. According to Chief Calebs, this accident is an example of many where locating a caller is
            problematic. As he describes it, the time it can take for some callers to reach dispatch, and the lost time taken locating the scenes of accidents, can be the difference between life and death.

            <br><br>
            Chief Calebs explained that inadequate cell phone coverage and unmarked roads are common issues encountered by his department when responding to emergency calls. Many regions in the county experience poor or no cell service. Many of these
            roads are unmarked, increasing the level of difficulty experienced searching for callers. While county engineers work to update signage in the area, signs are often knocked down by snow plows, may be vandalized or disappear for unknown
            reasons.

            To reach a lot of these unmarked locations, EMT drivers use different forms of GPS systems like google and apple maps. When these systems fail due to service issues or even lack of location, drivers are able to call back to an 911
            operator, to have them help locate the caller. It can take EMS to reach a caller in rural Athens County anywhere from 10-30 minutes, with the turnaround to a local hospital reaching around 60-75 minutes.

            Common issues for which Athens EMS receives calls include shortness of breath, chest pain, lung problems, heart problems and long-term health issues. Southeast Ohio experiences disproportionally high levels of illnesses such as
            depression, heart disease, and diabetes. This health crisis has gained the attention of health professionals in the area, who are seeking solutions that are accessible and reliable for patients.

            David Lee Pannell, 63, lives in Marietta, Ohio and visits the mobile health unit once a month in Coolville, Ohio. Pannell is diagnosed with diabetes and needs the free care and prescriptions that the unit provides, without these he would

            When the uninsured or underinsured are unable to access care, the worlds of Sheri Oliver and Chief Calebs can collide. Calebs says that some community members may not call an ambulance because they cannot afford it. When these uninsured
            members of the community do not see doctors regularly, their health issues can snowball into more protracted problems and lead to more intense situations for EMS. In addition, once they enter the health care system, the costs for care are
            higher than the initial visit would have been because their conditions are so much worse.

              working to improve the community’s quality of life in the Tri-County area since the early 1960’s.
              <br><br>
              One of the five divisions of the nonprofit’s focus is transportation. In HAPCAP’s transit office, Athens and Hocking County mobility manager, Jessie Schmitzer, plays a key role in managing the services that HAPCAP offers. “Athens On
              Demand Transit is a door to door service that services all of Athens county and services anybody for any reason,” Schmitzer said. Originally provided for senior citizens and individuals with disabilities, as of Jan. 1, 2020, HAPAP has
              opened Athens On Demand for use by anyone, for the cost of $2 one way.

              lternative long-distance medical transport options are available for some residents of Southeast Ohio. Paula Peterson, of Albany Ohio, feels satisfied with her two medical care services: Hopewell and PASSPORT. Peterson is a disabled
              senior citizen, and is able to receive transportation through both of these services.
              <br><br>
              After being injured in 2008 while working as a nurse’s aide, Peterson had back surgery for a fractured vertebrae and discovered severe scoliosis. Through PASSPORT, a waiver program administered through Ohio Medicaid, Peterson is
              assigned a nurse case manager and receives home health aide two days a week.
              <br><br>
              “They've really helped me out a lot,” Peterson said. “If I've got to go even as far as Columbus to the doctors, PASSPORT will pay for it.”
              <br><br>
              “I'm doing pretty well, thanks be to God,” Peterson said.
              <br><br>
              Peterson is also doing well despite the spread of COVID-19. Spending time with her grandchildren is what Peterson misses the most. “I'm doing really great, and I don't see why that couldn't continue.” Peterson said she is pretty well
              isolated to begin with, so the COVID-19 pandemic has not changed her life much. She washes her hands more and disinfects her apartment once a week.

              Although this time is mostly stress free for Peterson, there is a concern for her daughter-in-law. “She's in the emergency room right now and they're testing her for Corona. So that's stressing me out.” Peterson uses FaceTime to talk to
              her family during
              <br><br>
              “I'm really not terribly worried about it,” Peterson said. “My family has been really good about staying away since everything went to lock down.”

              In the past month, some have raised concerns about the availability of coronavirus tests to Southeast Ohio due to the lack of healthcare access in the area.
              <br><br>
              In response to these concerns, Ohio House Rep, Jay Edwards, R-Nelsonville, has stated that the area is not running low on test kits. Edwards says that Southeast Ohio is “on par per capita with other areas of the state.”
              <br><br>
              OhioHealth O'Bleness Hospital has begun preparation for possible COVID-19 surges by erecting emergency “triage tents” outside of the hospital in the Emergency Department. At the moment, the tents are prepared as a precautionary measure.
              Spread of COVID-19 in the community has not yet reached a level that requires patient triage.
              <br><br>
              Two tents are set up and a third will soon accompany them. Each tent will serve a different purpose. Patients are to be evaluated at the first tent and depending on the physician’s determination the patient will go into a tent for
              definite COVID-19 or a tent for possible COVID-19.
              <br><br>
              These tents are not for coronavirus testing.
